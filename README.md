This is a Python project, performing age and gender detection on faces in real-time using OpenCV's deep neural networks. It also performs object detection on the full-sized frame to detect objects within the face region.

The script uses pre-trained models that are loaded into memory using the "cv2.dnn.readNet" method. These models include:

"age_net.caffemodel" and "age_deploy.prototxt" for age detection
"gender_net.caffemodel" and "gender_deploy.prototxt" for gender detection
"opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb" and "opencv_face_detector.pbtxt" for face detection
"MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel" and "MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt" for object detection
The script captures frames from the default camera (index 0) using "cv2.VideoCapture(0)" and processes each frame with the following steps:

The frame is resized to a smaller size for better optimization.
Face detection is performed on the smaller frame using the face detection model.
If a face is detected, the script performs gender and age detection on the face region using their respective models.
Object detection is performed on the full-sized frame using the object detection model within the face region.
The results of the detections are drawn onto the original frame and displayed in two windows: one for age and gender detection and the other for object detection.
The script also prints the time taken to process each frame.
